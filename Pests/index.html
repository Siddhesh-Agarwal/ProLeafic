                <p>Death of shoot tips; feeding damage to fruit, usually at stem end; larvae are dark brown and white

                Insect
                <h2>Management</h2>
                Most effective method of treatment is well-timed applications of insecticide around time of bloom;
                organically acceptable insecticides include Bacillus thuringiensis or Entrust; infestations can also be
                treated with appropriate organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides.

                Setts not rooting; central soft portion of set has red discoloration which turns brown-black; cavities

                <h2>Cause</h2>
                Fungus
                <h2>Management</h2>
                The most effective method of managing the disease is through the use of resistant sugarcane varieties;
                if planting varieties that are susceptible to the disease then plant them in dry, well-draining soils

                Leaves of plant rolled and tied together with silk webbing; feeding damage to rolled leaves; defoliation

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                Mature trees generally tolerate damage well; if damage is caused to shoot tips of young trees then
                growth may be stunted; shallow, irregularly shaped areas may be present on fruit surface where insect
                has fed; insects are brown and shiny with a pincer-like structure at the end of the abdomen; can reach
                1.3 cm (0.5 in) in length.
                <h2>Cause</h2>
                Insect
                <h2>Management</h2>
                Remove all weeds from around tree bases; remove all pruning debris and loose bark around trees; wrapping
                trunks tightly with plastic wrap before nymphs emerge can stop them climbing up the tree; if using
                insecticide, apply early in Spring when earwigs begin to be active

                <h1>Aphids</h1>
                <p>
                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                Small soft bodied insects on underside of leaves and/or stems of plant; usually green or yellow in
                color, woolly apple aphids are covered in masses of white, wool-like material; green apple aphids are
                dark green when they forst hatch and change to yellow-green with darker green spots as they mature; if
                aphid infestation is heavy it may cause leaves to yellow and/or distorted, necrotic spots on leaves
                and/or stunted shoots; aphids secrete a sticky, sugary substance called honeydew which encourages the
                growth of sooty mold on the plants.
                <h2>Cause</h2>
                Insects
                <h2>Management</h2>
                If aphid population is limited to just a few leaves or shoots then the infestation can be pruned out to
                provide control; check transplants for aphids before planting; use tolerant varieties if available;
                reflective mulches such as silver colored plastic can deter aphids from feeding on plants; sturdy plants
                can be sprayed with a strong jet of water to knock aphids from leaves; insecticides are generally only
                required to treat aphids if the infestation is very high - plants generally tolerate low and medium
                level infestation; insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem or canola oil are usually the best method of
                control; always check the labels of the products for specific usage guidelines prior to use.

                ensure air supply to fruit; spray fruit with insecticide prior to eggs being laid.

                Holes and burrows in fruit; holes may be blocked with crumbly brown frass (insect excrement); wounds may
                be shallow or may be deep burrows extending to the fruit’s core; adult insect is a dark brown moth;
                larvae are pink with a brown head and may be up to 1.3 cm (0.5 in) long.
                <h2>Cause</h2>
                Insect
                <h2>Management</h2>
                Proper pruning methods help to open out tree canopy to ensure treatments penetrate interior of the tree
                and reach larvae; removal of any wild hosts or trees in abandoned orchards helps remove reservoirs of
                insect; organically acceptable control methods include application of Entrust and kaolin clay; small
                scale growers and home gardeners can remove infested fruit by hand before larvae leaves fruit to reduce
                insect population; successful reduction of insect population in large scale orchards is usually achieved
                by mating disruption by releasing pheromones over successive years.

                <h2>Cause</h2>
                Insect
                <h2>Management</h2>
                Control of leafhoppers is becoming problematic as they are developing resistance to organophosphate
                insecticides; sprays of appropriate insecticides are most effective at controlling the insect before the
                adults emerge; monitor trees for appearance of nymphs.
