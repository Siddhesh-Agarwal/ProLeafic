                <p>
                    Most powdery mildew are very host specific, mildew on cucumbers will not infect roses. Look for
                    white, powdery growth on leaves and shoots. Warm days and cool nights are ideal for powdery mildew
                    development. Particularly susceptible: roses, gooseberries, hascaps,
                    lupines and cucumbers.</p>
                <h2>Powdery Mildew Control</h2>
                <p>
                    Plant disease resistant varieties. Avoid planting in shady areas or areas with poor air
                    circulation.
                    To be effective, a fungicides spray program must start before mildew is well established. A
                    dormant
                    spray of lime sulfur will reduce overwintering fungus on twigs. If mildew does become
                    established,
                    remove and destroy infected leaves. For complete protection of your plant spray with
                    copper-based or
                    sulfur-based fungicide Spray every 10 days from spring through to the fall.
                    If you’re growing fruit or vegetables, powdery mildew can cripple flowers and sometimes cause
                    unsightly damage to the crop. If you apply a one spray to fruit trees just before bloom, one
                    more
                    just after bloom and another two weeks later, most damage from this disease will be prevented.

                back hard before growth starts in the spring to remove infected shoots. In spring and early summer
                apply a spray of sulfur or copper-based fungicide. Apply this treatment at 1 to 2 week intervals
                through the growing season periodically alternating the fungicide used.

                    This is a bacterial disease of cool, wet weather areas that attacks cherries, peaches plums,
                    apricots and related trees. It spreads readily from early spring till June when the weather warms up
                    on the West Coast. Most large cherry trees in the Fraser Valley are infected with this disease. It
                    spreads readily in splashing rain from infected trees killing buds, blossoms and twigs often
                    accompanied by gumming when it rains. Infected cherry fruit develop numerous small sunken black
                    spots. Small black spots may appear on leaves, later dropping out to leave a shot hole
                    appearance.<br>
                <h2>Bacterial Canker or Blight Control</h2><br>
                There are no resistant cultivars. Prune out dead twigs and cankers on large branches cutting 40 cm
                below the diseased area. Only prune during dry weather to avoid spreading the disease. Sprays of
                copper-based fungicide should help prevent future infections. Make the first application prior to
                fall rains in September, repeat at leaf drop and again twice more before the buds open in the
                spring.

                    Particularly susceptible plants include: Hollyhock, heuchera, daylilies, pears, Rhododendrons and
                    Juniper.
                    Juniper is an obligatory alternate host for the rust that infects pears. To prevent
                    this disease, plant either pears or Juniper, not both unless they are more than 30 meters apart.
                    The rusts that infects rhododendrons, Hollyhock, daylilies and hechera do not have an alternate
                    host.<br>
                <h2>Rust Control</h2><br>
                Plant resistant cultivars. At first sign of the disease, remove infected leaves and start spraying
                plants every 10 days with a copper or sulfur-based fungicide.

                    May or June in wet years. Late blight forms irregular greenish black, water soaked blotches first on
                    older leaves or stems quickly spreading to the fruit. This disease usually doesn’t appear until
                    August in wet years, but it can destroy entire plants overnight.<br>
                <h2>Late Blight and Early Blight Control</h2><br>
                Space and prune plans for good air circulation. Avoid overhead watering. If Early blight starts to
                appear, pick off and destroy the infected leaves. If chemical control is required apply a copper
                spray at 7 to 10 day intervals. If late blight starts to appear remove diseased leaves or entire
                plants immediately, seal in a plastic bag and send to the landfill. Do not compost late blight
                infected plants. Apply a copper spray at every 5 to 10 days till allowed days before harvest.

                Plant resistant apple cultivars such as Liberty, Florina and Bramley’s seedling (partially
                resistant). Prune mature trees to allow good air circulation. Rake up and destroy fallen leaves to
                reduce the overwintering fungus. If you have susceptible apple varieties several fungicide sprays
                are required: the first at bud break; second, just before bloom; third, one week after bloom; and
                another two weeks later. Use sulfur-based fungicides - lime sulfur or wettable sulfur.

                <h1>Mosaic Virus</h1>
                <p>
                <h2>Problem:</h2> There are a number of mosaic viruses, but gardeners are most likely to encounter
                two:
                tomato mosaic virus and tobacco mosaic virus. The former infects tomatoes, peppers, potatoes,
                apples, pears and cherries; the latter infects tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, beets,
                petunias and, of course, tobacco.
                Mosaic virus causes mottled yellow and green leaves that are sometimes curled and distorted. Some
                plants exhibit yellowing, stunted growth, malformed fruits and reduced yield. Mosaic virus is more
                common in hot weather.<br>
                <h2>Solution:</h2> There are no chemical controls, but resistant varieties exist. The virus can live
                in dry
                soil for some time. Remove and destroy infected plants, roots and all, and avoid planting
                susceptible plants in the same area for two years. Because tobacco is a carrier, smokers should
                wash
                hands thoroughly before handling plants.

                <p>
                <h2>Problem:</h2> Verticillium wilt is a fungal disease that affects hundreds of species of trees,
                shrubs,
                edibles and ornamentals (see list of susceptible plants here). Pathogens, which can live in the soil
                for years, make their way into the plant through the roots, eventually clogging the vascular system
                and causing branches to wilt suddenly and foliage to turn yellow and fall off prematurely. It can
                also lead to stunted growth.<br>
                <h2>Solution:</h2> Fungicides are not effective, but good sanitation practices may help. Remove and
                destroy
                infected annuals, perennials and edibles. Prune diseased branches off trees and shrubs. (When
                you do
                this, you’ll notice a telltale green streak or stain in the wood.) Sterilizing cutting tools
                with a
                10 percent bleach solution between cuts.

                <p>
                <h2>Problem:</h2> Snow mold is a fungus that flourishes in the cold, moist conditions found beneath
                snow. It attacks turf grass. After snow melts, symptoms become visible: light tan areas of matted
                grass caused by threads of mold.<br>
                <h2>Solution:</h2> Rake the matted grass to break up the mold and allow for new growth. In fall, make
                the
                last cutting of the year shorter to discourage tall grass blades from falling over and
                contributing

                <h1>Sooty Mold</h1>
                <p>
                <h2>Problem:</h2> Sooty mold refers to fungi that grow on the sticky deposits, called honeydew, left
                by plant-sucking insects. On leaves it’s not only unsightly; it impedes photosynthesis and stunts
                plant growth. Leaves coated with sooty mold also drop off prematurely.<br>
                <h2>Solution:</h2> To deal with sooty mold, you have to deal with the plant-sucking insects leaving
                the
                honeydew, such as aphids, leafhoppers and mealybugs. Spray them with insecticidal soap or neem
                oil.
                Ants are attracted to the honeydew for food, so they protect the plant-sucking insects from
                predatory insects that would otherwise keep a lid on the pest population. Trap ants or, with
                woody
                plants, paint a sticky compound such as Tanglefoot around stems.

                    terminal
                    growth and small leaves; around midsummer the whole tree suddenly collapses; in orchards trees
                    usually die in a circular pattern; infected trees often have a fan-shaped white fungal mat
                    growing
                    between the bark and wood of the crown.</p>

                    Once a tree is infected there is no treatment and it should be removed, fumigants do
                    not control

                <p>Galls of various sizes on roots and root crown below the soil line; galls may occasionally grow on

                    and spongy or hard; if galling is severe and girdles the trunk then young trees are weakened due to
                    constricted vascular tissue; trees may be stunted and rarely die.</p>

                <h2>Comments:</h2>
                <p>The bacterium enters host plants through wounds and causes plant cells to proliferate and

                <p>Only plant disease-free nursery stock; plant trees in well-draining soils; avoid
                    wounding the plants as much as possible; fresh wounds can be treated with a biocontrol agent
                    (Agrobacterium tumefaciens K84), if available, to prevent the bacterium colonizing</p>
