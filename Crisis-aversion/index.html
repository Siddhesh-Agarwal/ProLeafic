                    <li>Check your pot for proper drainage and, if possible, create additional air space around the
                        roots. This will allow oxygen to reach the root zone. Remove any dead or dying roots and keep
                        only the roots that are healthy.</li>
                    <li>Water only when the soil is dry to the touch, but do not let it get too dry. You should also
                        seize all fertilization at this point until the plant is healthy again.</li>
                    <li>Treat with a fungicide.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There is never a guarantee that your plant can bounce back from overwatering. If your plant is going
                    to survive, you will see results within a week or so. At this point, you can move your plant back to
                    its original location and resume watering it as normal. It's important to water your plants properly
                    from the start and to make sure they have plenty of drainage. If you tend to overwater plants
                    despite your best efforts, it might be best to avoid any plants that are more prone to problems from
                    too much water.

                <p>If your plant is severely underwatered, the best the you can do is practice a little “bottom
                    watering”. Bottom watering is allowing the plants to drink from the bottom up, as much as they want,
                    for up to 24 hours. In addition to this, you may also water over the soil. Above all, you want to
                    make sure the plant has plenty of time to drink, as a regular watering for underwatered plants often
                    results in the water quickly running through dry soil, not allowing the roots time to drink up.

            <div class="content">
                <p>Too much fertilizer is not good for a plant and can cause freezer burn. If you suspect you may have
                    over fertilized your plants, treat the area as soon as possible. Treat spillage by scooping up as
                    much of the fertilizer as possible. The only thing you can do for over fertilized soil is flush the
                    soil with as much water as it will hold over the next few days. Don’t allow the water to run off.
                    Toxic runoff can contaminate nearby areas and may get into waterways where it causes substantial
                    damage to the environment. Water slowly to allow the water to sink in rather than run off.

                    <li>Plant heavy nitrogen feeding plants – tomatoes, corn, broccoli, cabbage and spinach are examples

                    <li>Water – soaking your soil with water will help leach the nitrogen deeper into your soil,

                    <li>Sugar – In limited studies, it was shown that adding sugar to your soil can help potentially
                        reduce the amount of nitrogen is your soil. Sugar is partially composed of carbon, an element
                        which attracts and soaks up the nitrogen in the soil. This is similar concept to adding
                        sawdust/woodchips which are high in carbon content.</li>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Shift the soil and remove as many rocks as possible. This will prevent minerals in rocks, such as
                    feldspar and mica, from releasing potassium into the soil. Loosen the soil with a garden fork or
                    shovel, then water deeply to dissolve and flush out the surplus in potassium-rich soil. Allow the
                    soil to dry completely, then repeat two or three more times. Grow a cover crop of legumes that will
                    fix nitrogen in the soil. This practice will meet the soil’s needs for nitrogen without increasing
                    phosphorus or potassium. If the area is small, digging in crushed seashells or eggshells may help
                    balance soil nutrients.

        <div class="container1">
            <div class="content">
                <p>To correct problems caused by excessive soil phosphorus, begin by avoiding future phosphorus
                    applications. This includes eliminating organic composts and manures. If organic nitrogen sources or
                    mulches are needed, use very low phosphorus products such as blood meal (as a nitrogen source) or
                    pine bark mulch. Apply a 0.5 to 1 percent solution of both iron and zinc to the plant tissue. If a
                    stock nutrient solution contains 10 percent iron and 10 percent zinc, one part stock nutrient
                    solution should be mixed with nine to 19 parts water. The solution should be sprayed on plant leaves
                    just to the point of runoff. Follow-up applications probably will be required, but timing depends on
                    the level of deficiency, the time of year, and iron and zinc requirements of the plants being
                    treated. In general, the solution should be applied every 1 to 4 weeks or at the first signs of
                    deficiency.

                    Pruning is a technique that is incorporated world wide and used on a large commercial scale. Pruning
                    plants simply means cleaning the foliage of the plant so that what is left behind, will spend the
                    time focusing its energy on the remaining growth. The best thing to do when growing plants, is to
                    totally strip the entire bottom parts of the plant and some growers will even strip away to one
                    internode, before finally flowering the plants. The same is done with tomatoes but not as excessive,
                    as the principal is the plant will now produce all of the fruits and flowers from the top part of
                    the left behind growth. This may seem totally and utterly counter productive and seems you are
                    wasting what has taken the last 4-8 weeks to grow. However, incorporating this technique is strongly
                    advised as a brilliant way to grow top heavy fruits without any unwanted lower bearing fruits.
